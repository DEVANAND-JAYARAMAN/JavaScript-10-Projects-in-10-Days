A Personal Challenge to Strengthen My JavaScript Skills  This repository is the result of my 10-day coding challenge where I built 10 JavaScript projects in 10 days. The goal was to improve my JavaScript fundamentals, practice DOM manipulation, and get more comfortable building interactive web features from scratch.  These projects are simple, beginner-level builds that helped me stay consistent and focused while learning by doing.
